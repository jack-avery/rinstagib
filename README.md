## Building

* Run `make sm` (`make sm-win` if on Windows) to build SourceMod and MetaMod into `./build/_sm`.
* Run `make all` (`make all-win` if on Windows) to build SourceMod, MetaMod, and set up configuration for all instances defined in `cfg` into `./build_instances`.

Suggested configuration is in `cfg/all`.
